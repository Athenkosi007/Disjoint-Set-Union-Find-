# Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of the Disjoint Set (also known as Union-Find) data structure in C#. It supports:

- Creating sets (MakeSet)

- Finding the root of a set (Find)

- Merging sets (Union)

- Checking if two elements belong to the same set (Connected)

This structure is efficient for solving problems involving dynamic connectivity.
